# Testing Ahoy LSP in Zed

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for testing the Ahoy Language Server in Zed.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install ahoy-lsp:**
   ```bash
   cd ahoy/lsp
   go build -o ahoy-lsp .
   mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
   cp ahoy-lsp ~/.local/bin/
   ```

2. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   which ahoy-lsp
   # Should output: /home/username/.local/bin/ahoy-lsp
   
   # Test it runs
   ahoy-lsp
   # Should wait for input (press Ctrl+C to exit)
   ```

3. **Install Zed extension:**
   ```bash
   cd zed-ahoy
   cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release
   cp target/wasm32-wasip1/release/ahoy.wasm extension.wasm
   ./install_to_zed.sh
   ```

4. **Restart Zed completely** (close all windows and reopen)

## Test File

Create `test_zed.ahoy`:

```ahoy
? Ahoy Language - Zed LSP Test File

? ==================== FUNCTION DEFINITIONS ====================
add :: |a:int, b:int| int:
    return a plus b

multiply :: |x:int, y:int| int:
    return x times y

greet :: |name:string| string:
    return "Hello, " plus name

? ==================== VARIABLES ====================
num1: 10
num2: 20
sum: add|num1, num2|
product: multiply|num1, num2|
message: greet|"World"|

? ==================== CONDITIONALS ====================
if sum greater_than product then
    print|"Sum is greater"|
anif product greater_than sum then
    print|"Product is greater"|
else
    print|"They are equal"|

? ==================== LOOPS ====================
loop:1 to 10 do
    print|"Iteration"|

? ==================== ARRAYS ====================
numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
loop num in numbers do
    print|"Number: %v", num|

? ==================== OBJECTS ====================
point: <x: 100, y: 200>
color: <r: 255, g: 128, b: 64>

? ==================== TEST INSTRUCTIONS ====================
? 1. Hover over "add" on line 6 - should show function signature
? 2. Ctrl+Click on "add" on line 15 - should jump to line 6
? 3. Press Ctrl+Shift+O (Cmd+Shift+O on Mac) - should show document outline
? 4. Type "lo" at the end of file + trigger completion - should suggest "loop"
? 5. Delete ":" after "int:" on line 6 - should show red squiggle error
```

## Testing Checklist

Open `test_zed.ahoy` in Zed and verify each feature:

### 1. Extension Loading âœ“

- [ ] File opens with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Bottom-right shows "Ahoy" as the language
- [ ] No error notifications on startup

**If not working:**
- Check extension installed: `ls ~/.local/share/zed/extensions/installed/ahoy`
- Reload window: Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P â†’ "zed: reload window"

### 2. LSP Server Starting âœ“

- [ ] Status bar shows LSP indicator
- [ ] No "Language server failed" error

**Check logs:**
```bash
tail -f ~/.local/share/zed/logs/Zed.log | grep -i ahoy
```

Should see:
- "[ahoy-lsp] Starting Ahoy Language Server"
- "[ahoy-lsp] Server created successfully"

**If not starting:**
- Verify binary: `which ahoy-lsp`
- Check PATH: `echo $PATH | grep ".local/bin"`
- Set explicit path in settings (see ZED_CONFIGURATION.md)

### 3. Diagnostics (Error Detection) âœ“

**Test 1: Syntax Error**
- [ ] Delete `:` after `int:` on line 6
- [ ] Red squiggle or error indicator should appear
- [ ] Hover over error shows message
- [ ] Undo (Cmd/Ctrl+Z)
- [ ] Error disappears

**Test 2: Invalid Keyword**
- [ ] Add line: `function wrong()`
- [ ] Should show error (Ahoy doesn't use `function`)
- [ ] Delete the line
- [ ] Error clears

**If not working:**
- LSP may not be connected
- Check logs for connection errors
- Try reload window

### 4. Hover Information âœ“

- [ ] Hover over `add` on line 6
  - Should show: Function signature or type info
  
- [ ] Hover over `if` keyword on line 23
  - Should show: Documentation about conditionals
  
- [ ] Hover over `loop` keyword on line 30
  - Should show: Documentation about loops

- [ ] Hover over variable `sum` on line 15
  - Should show: Variable type or value info

**If not working:**
- Make sure there are no syntax errors (they prevent AST creation)
- Check cursor is on the correct token
- Try reloading window

### 5. Go to Definition âœ“

**Test 1: Function Definition**
- [ ] Place cursor on `add` at line 15 (in `sum: add|num1, num2|`)
- [ ] Press F12 or Cmd/Ctrl+Click
- [ ] Should jump to line 6 (function definition)
- [ ] Press Cmd/Ctrl+- to go back

**Test 2: Another Function**
- [ ] Place cursor on `multiply` at line 16
- [ ] Press F12
- [ ] Should jump to line 9
- [ ] Go back

**Test 3: Variable**
- [ ] Place cursor on `num1` at line 15
- [ ] Press F12
- [ ] Should jump to line 13 (variable definition)

**If not working:**
- Ensure no syntax errors in file
- Symbol must be in scope
- Try reloading window

### 6. Autocompletion âœ“

- [ ] Go to end of file (after line 40)
- [ ] Type: `lo`
- [ ] Trigger completion (Cmd/Ctrl+Space or automatic)
- [ ] Should see `loop` in suggestions
- [ ] Escape to cancel

- [ ] Type: `if`
- [ ] Trigger completion
- [ ] Should see `if`, `then` suggestions
- [ ] Escape to cancel

- [ ] Type: `re`
- [ ] Trigger completion
- [ ] Should see `return` suggestion
- [ ] Escape to cancel

**If not working:**
- Completions may require typing more characters
- Check if completion is enabled in settings
- Try Cmd/Ctrl+Space manually

### 7. Document Symbols âœ“

- [ ] Press Cmd+Shift+O (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+O (Linux)
- [ ] Should see outline with:
  - `add` (function)
  - `multiply` (function)
  - `greet` (function)
  - `num1`, `num2`, `sum`, `product`, etc. (variables)

- [ ] Type "add" to filter
- [ ] Press Enter to jump to symbol
- [ ] Should navigate to function definition

**If not working:**
- Ensure file has no syntax errors
- Try reloading window
- Check if symbols are being parsed (hover should work)

### 8. Code Actions âœ“

- [ ] Place cursor on a line with an error
- [ ] Press Cmd/Ctrl+. (period)
- [ ] Should see quick fix suggestions
- [ ] Try applying one

**Note:** Code actions require errors to suggest fixes.

**If not working:**
- Not all errors have code actions
- Feature may be limited in current version

### 9. Error Recovery âœ“

**Test server doesn't crash:**
- [ ] Add lots of invalid syntax:
  ```
  function bad() { wrong syntax !!! ### garbage
  ```
- [ ] Server should NOT crash
- [ ] Errors should appear
- [ ] Fix the syntax
- [ ] Errors should clear
- [ ] All features should still work

**If server crashes:**
- Check logs for panic messages
- Report as a bug with reproduction steps

### 10. Performance âœ“

- [ ] File opens quickly (< 1 second)
- [ ] Typing is responsive (no lag)
- [ ] Hover appears quickly (< 100ms)
- [ ] Go-to-def is instant
- [ ] Completions appear quickly

**If slow:**
- File may be very large (>1000 lines)
- Try smaller file for testing
- Check CPU usage

## Viewing Logs

### Real-time Logs
```bash
tail -f ~/.local/share/zed/logs/Zed.log | grep -i ahoy
```

### All Zed Logs
```bash
cat ~/.local/share/zed/logs/Zed.log | grep -i ahoy | tail -50
```

### What to Look For

**Good signs:**
```
[ahoy-lsp] Starting Ahoy Language Server
[ahoy-lsp] Server created successfully
[ahoy-lsp] Handler started, waiting for requests
```

**Bad signs:**
```
ahoy-lsp not found
Failed to start language server
LSP connection error
```

## Common Issues

### "LSP not starting"

1. **Check binary exists:**
   ```bash
   which ahoy-lsp
   ls -l ~/.local/bin/ahoy-lsp
   ```

2. **Check PATH:**
   ```bash
   echo $PATH | grep ".local/bin"
   ```

3. **Set explicit path in Zed settings:**
   
   Edit `~/.config/zed/settings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "lsp": {
       "ahoy-lsp": {
         "binary": {
           "path": "/home/username/.local/bin/ahoy-lsp"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Reload Zed:**
   - Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P â†’ "zed: reload window"

### "Features not working"

1. **Wrong syntax:**
   - Ahoy uses `::` for functions, not `function`
   - See test file above for correct syntax

2. **Syntax errors:**
   - Fix all errors first
   - LSP needs valid syntax to build AST

3. **Not recognized as Ahoy:**
   - Check bottom-right shows "Ahoy"
   - File must have `.ahoy` extension

### "Extension not loading"

1. **Reinstall:**
   ```bash
   cd zed-ahoy
   ./install_to_zed.sh
   ```

2. **Check installation:**
   ```bash
   ls ~/.local/share/zed/extensions/installed/ahoy/
   # Should show: extension.toml, extension.wasm, etc.
   ```

3. **Rebuild:**
   ```bash
   cargo clean
   cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release
   cp target/wasm32-wasip1/release/ahoy.wasm extension.wasm
   ```

## Success Criteria

âœ… All 10 tests pass
âœ… No errors in logs
âœ… Features work smoothly
âœ… Server doesn't crash on invalid input
âœ… Performance is good

If all tests pass: **Zed LSP integration is working!** ðŸŽ‰

## Next Steps

After successful testing:

1. Write real Ahoy code with LSP support
2. Test with larger projects
3. Configure settings for your workflow (see ZED_CONFIGURATION.md)
4. Report any issues found
5. Contribute improvements
